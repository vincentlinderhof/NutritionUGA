#' Section 8 of the household questionnaire
#' contains information about the primary
#' and secondary job of all household members
#' above 5 years old. However, What is not
#' asked is how much income was actually earnt
#' by the respondent in the last week. Instead
#' we only know how much was earnt in the last
#' week and how many months per year the
#' respondent has worked.

#' Section 11 contains other household income
